# Homework1
///For this particular homework we were asked to:
-view the source code
-find semantic HTML elements
-view the structure of the HTML elements
-find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
-view the image elements
-find accessible alt attributes
-view the heading attributes
-fall in sequential order
-view the title element
-find a concise, descriptive title

I first started to complete my homework by adding an appropriate title 'Horiseon Homepage'. Then checked if the semantic HTML elements were there and most of the elements were there except the meta viewport tag which I then added on line 6. This tag will allow the code to be responsive to different devices and screen pixels.

I then checked if the elements and the body followed a logical structure and according to the webpage the elements and body were fairly matched. 

Then inorder for the page to be accessible friendly I added alt attributes to the images with a title that best matches what the image represents. For example for the image in the "Brand Awareness" section I added the alt atribute "Brand Awareness Icon".

And lastly in order for the code to read easier I changed some of the div tags and gave them names that describe which part of the webpage the code represents. For example for the section of the webpage that is floating on the right I named that tag //<SideBar>, and the footer of the page <Bottom> etc.

Lastly I ran the page to see if any name change or attribute that were added interfered with the code and altered the webpage and thankfull it didn't.
